``cryptography`` is a package designed to expose cryptographic recipes and
primitives to Python developers.

It is currently in early development and isn't recommended for general usage
yet. It targets Python 2.6-2.7, Python 3.2+, as well as PyPy.

You can find more information in the `documentation`_.
