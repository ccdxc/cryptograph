.. currentmodule:: cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.rsa

`RSA`_ is a `public-key`_ algorithm for encrypting and signing messages.

.. class:: RSAPrivateKey(p, q, private_exponent, public_exponent, modulus)
    
    .. versionadded:: 0.2

    An RSA private key is required for decryption and signing of messages.

    Normally you do not need to directly construct private keys because you'll
    be loading them from a file or generating them automatically.

    .. warning::
        This method only checks a limited set of properties of its arguments.
        Using an RSA that you do not trust or with incorrect parameters may
        lead to insecure operation, crashes, and other undefined behavior. We
        recommend that you only ever load private keys that were generated with
        software you trust.

    This class conforms to the
    :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.interfaces.RSAPrivateKey`
    interface.

    :raises TypeError: This is raised when the arguments are not all integers. 

    :raises ValueError: This is raised when the values of `p`, `q`,
                        `private_exponent`, `public_exponent` or `modulus` do 
                        not match the bounds specified in `RFC 3447`_.

.. class:: RSAPublicKey(public_exponent, modulus)
    
    .. versionadded:: 0.2

    An RSA public key is required for encryption and verification of messages.

    Normally you do not need to directly construct public keys because you'll
    be loading them from a file, generating them automatically or receiving
    them from a 3rd party.

    This class conforms to the
    :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.interfaces.RSAPublicKey`
    interface.

    :raises TypeError: This is raised when the arguments are not all integers. 

    :raises ValueError: This is raised when the values of `public_exponent` or
                        `modulus` do not match the bounds specified in
                        `RFC 3447`_
