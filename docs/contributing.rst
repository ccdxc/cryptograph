Contributing
============

Process
-------

As an open source project, ``cryptography`` welcomes contributions of all
forms. These can include:

* Bug reports and feature requests
* Pull requests for both code and documentation
* Patch reviews

You can file bugs and submit pull requests on `GitHub`_. To discuss larger
changes you can start a conversation on `our mailing list`_.

Because cryptography is so complex, and the implications of getting it wrong so
devastating, ``cryptography`` has a strict code review policy:

* Patches must *never* be pushed directly to ``master``, all changes (even the
  most trivial typo fixes!) must be submitted as a pull request.
* A committer may *never* merge their own pull request, a second party must
  merge their changes. If multiple people work on a pull request, the merger
  may not be any of them.
* A patch which breaks tests, or introduces regressions by changing or removing
  existing tests should not be merged. Tests must always be passing on
  ``master``.
* If somehow the tests get into a failing state on ``master`` (such as by a
  backwards incompatible release of a dependency) no pull requests may be
  merged until this is rectified.

The purpose of these policies is to minimize the chances we merge a change
which jeopardizes our users' security.

We do not yet have a formal security contact. To report security issues in
``cryptography`` you should email ``alex.gaynor@gmail.com``, messages may be
encrypted with PGP to key fingerprint
``E27D 4AA0 1651 72CB C5D2  AF2B 125F 5C67 DFE9 4084`` (this public key is
available from most commonly-used keyservers).

Code
----

When in doubt, refer to `PEP 8`_ for Python code.

Every code file must start with the boilerplate notice of the Apache License.
Additionally, every Python code file must contain

.. code-block:: python

    from __future__ import absolute_import, division, print_function

Documentation
-------------

All features should be documented with prose.

Docstrings should be written like this:

.. code-block:: python

    def some_function(some_arg):
        """
        Does some things.

        :param some_arg: Some argument.
        """

So, specifically:

- Always use three double quotes.
- Put the three double quotes on their own line.
- No blank line at the end.
- Use Sphinx parameter/attribute documentation `syntax`_.
